# InvenioILS Demo Site

Welcome to your InvenioILS instance.

## Getting started

Run the `./setup.sh` script in order to setup your new InvenioILS instance.

Run the backend:

```console
pipenv run invenio run --cert docker/backend/test.crt --key docker/backend/test.key
```

**Note** The server will listen to HTTPS requests and it uses a self-signed SSL certificate.
If this is not the desired behaviour, you can run the server with HTTP only by:

1.  Changing REACT_APP_INVENIO_UI_URL and REACT_APP_INVENIO_REST_ENDPOINTS_BASE_URL variables in `ui/.env` file to run on `http` instead of `https`.
2.  Running the server without specifying the certificate: `FLASK_ENV=development pipenv run invenio run`

In a new terminal, start the celery worker. Make sure you are in the project folder (my-site) then run:

```console
celery -A invenio_app.celery worker -l INFO
```

To start the UI part:

Make sure you are using Node v18 or higher:

```console
node --version
```

Navigate to the `ui/` folder and run:

```console
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

The above commands first builds the application docker image and afterwards
starts the application and related services (database, Elasticsearch, Redis
and RabbitMQ). The build and boot process will take some time to complete,
especially the first time as docker images have to be downloaded during the
process.

Once running, visit https://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.
